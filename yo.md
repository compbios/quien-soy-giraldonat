## Natalia Giraldo


Hi! I'm Natalia Giraldo, a 25 years old *Biomedical Engineer* and I work as a Clinical Data Manager. <p>
In my spare time I like to read books, Listen to Music, learn and practice languages, do exercise and enjoy my life with my family & friends <p>
I've started a new challenge in my life which is Bullet Journaling. An inspire site for this activity is [EMMA'S STUDYBLR](https://emmastudies.com/printables)<p>
As a Child I used to dream of speaking different languages and at this moment of my life I think I'm reaching that Goal, I can speak three languages: **Spanish, English and French**. <p>
For this year I started my Master in *Biostatistics*, because I'm in love with data analysis. <p>

I love to program, so please do not hesitate to request my help, I'm more than glad to help you!<p>
*Some programming language and Softwares that I know are*: Matlab, Arduino, Labview, Pseint, MPLAB, visual studio, oracle, Pseint, Unity and Ansys.
